Hopefully over the next week I should have the first post (or two) live on here. I've got a backlog of
ideas and notes to work through so as a sneak peak of what's to come:

  - `Error First Design`: why taking the time to focus on the sad path first can often lead to a system
    that is easier to maintain and reason about.
  - `Axum webserver 101`: a getting started guide on how to set up, test and maintain webservers written
    using the fantastic [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework (from someone who has written
    and maintained several hundred thousand lines of Rust webservers using axum).
  - `Composable API design`: how to structure your APIs so that you get the most bang for your buck (and
    less time implementing feature requests from users).
  - `How does a text editor work?`: a series on what I've learned from writing [ad](https://github.com/sminez/ad).
