Hi, I'm Innes. A software engineer living in York, UK.

Day to day I work with a variety of technologies (primarily back-end and
scripting) in order to facilitate a dev-ops workflow for other engineers.

Outside of work I'm a photographer, amateur Physicist and Mathematician
([helping Dr John Williamson][1] with his theory of [Absolute Relativity][2])
and general nerd. I live in York with my amazing wife [Katie][3] and our two
wonderful/trouble making daughters.

Depending on what my current fixation is, I may be developing some software that
you might find interesting over on [GitHub](https://github.com/sminez).
