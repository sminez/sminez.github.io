See the main [Quicycle][0] website for details of our endevours and links to
conference videos. My contributions are primarily based around developing
software for working with `M.A.R.T` (the Mathematics of Absolute Relativity
Theory) named in memory and honor of founding Quicyclist, Dr. Martin van der Mark.

I also make use of the the software itself to aid in the development of
equations and investigation of solutions to differentials. (And, occasionally,
to develop visualisations like the one above.)

The pages shown on the left are some example uses of the software that I have
developed for this and my thoughts and ideas around the underlying algebraic
structure that we work with. I won't claim to be a Physicist but I _do_ enjoy
refctoring and simplifying algebraic physics and looking for more efficient
methods of finding exact solutions to the problems being proposed and solved by
Dr Williamson.
