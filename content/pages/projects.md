# Software

- [penrose][0]: A Rust library for writing your own X11 tiling window manager.
  - The design and API of the library is built around splitting the code base into IO logic
    that interacts with the X server and _pure_ logic that implements the core window manager
    functionality.
- [ad][1]: My attempt at writing my own terminal based text editor from scratch.
  - This has turned into a bit of a playground for API design and digging into implementing
    lower level functionality such as a regex engine and virtual file system wire protocols.
- [simple test case][2]: A tiny Rust proc-macro for writing parameterised tests.
  - I prefer to have as little magic and framework between my tests and the logic under test.
- [sandpiles][3]: Simple fractal generation using the [Abelian sandpile model][4].
  - Inspired by [this Numberphile video][5]: you've got to love a good fractal.

# Photography

I'm not great at coming up with names for my photography projects, so in the interest of putting
a pin in it I've settled for the following two categories:
  - [people][6]
  - [not people][7]

# Video

- [penrose from scratch][8]: a tutorial series taking an extended look at what is involved in writing
  your own X11 window manager using `penrose`.
  - The code for the resulting window manager can be found [here][9] on GitHub.
