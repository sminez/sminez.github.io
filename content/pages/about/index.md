![me](me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Innes! I'm a software engineer, photographer and general all around nerd. I have a habit of
telling people that I enjoy having hard problems to solve and then wondering why a lot of my time is
taken up solving hard problems.

For my day job I've worked for and with a variety of interesting people writing software and helping to
improve the way that people go about their day to day (details can be found on [LinkedIn][0] if that's
your sort of thing but I'm not very active there).

When I'm on my own time I have a very low tolerance for being bored so you'll often find me working on
my own [open source projects][1], taking [photographs][2] and helping physicists with hypercomplex
algebra and their associated [research][3].
