# My Photography

When I can, I like to get out and shoot with my Fujifilm X-Pro2. Partly because
I don't like the feel of them and largely because I can afford them, I _don't_
use Fuji "focus by wire" lenses or autofocus. Instead I use a set of cheap
Nikkor lenses that weigh about as much as the camera itself. The focus can be a
bit hit or miss but I love the results.

For want of a better categorising system, I group my shots into "people" and
"not people". The galleries below are hosted on Flickr but you can find my most
recent shots on Instagram.
